## Research
ISR Lab carries out a broad range of research in the areas of Information Seeking Behaviour (ISB) and Information Retrieval (IR). We are actively publishing our work in top international journals and conferences. We are also regularly organising workshops to develop the communities. Please see [Publications](/en/publications.html) for the outcomes of our activities.

Some of the recent topics that the lab has been keen to work are as follows.

- [Advanced Ranking Algorithms](#advanced-ranking-algorithms)
- [Searching Behaviour Analysis and Modelling](#searching-behaviour-analysis-and-modelling)
- [Evaluation of Information Access Technologies](#evaluation-of-information-access-technologies)

### Advanced Ranking Algorithms

In the Big Data era, the increase of the volume and diversity of searchable contents on the Web and that of users' information needs poses many challenges to retrieve relevant information objects. ISR Lab has developed advanced ranking algorithms to address the challenge. Some of the recent work on this area is as follow.

- [A Concise Integer Linear Programming Formulation for Implicit Search Result Diversification](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018710)
- [An In-Depth Study of Implicit Search Result Diversification](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48051-0_29)

### Searching Behaviour Analysis and Modelling

Given that search engines are one of the most interactive information systems, deep understanding of users and their behaviour in various conexts is a crucial part of developing new search technologies. ISR Lab has performed a number of user studies to analyse searching behaviour, and developed techniques to accurately model and predict the behaviour. Here is some of the recent studies we carried out.

- [Temporal information searching behaviour and strategies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457315000448)
- [Effect of search constraint on human perception, behaviour, and performance of search](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34752-8_5)
- [Analysing facial activity to detect personal highlights of multimedia contents](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-010-0632-x)

### Evaluation of Information Access Technologies

ISR Lab has got extensive experience of building and releasing resources, called *test collections*, for evaluating the performance of a range of Information Access technologies and their users. A test collection often consists of a set of search topics, document colletion, and relevance information, so that the performance of state-of-the-art techniques can be evaluated and compared under the common framework. Here is some of the recent test collections we built with our [collaborators](/en/collaboration.html#collaboration) under [NTCIR project](http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html).

- [NTCIR Actional Knowledge Graph (AKG)](http://ntcirakg.github.io/)
- [NTCIR Lifelog](http://ntcir-lifelog.computing.dcu.ie/)
- [NTCIR Temporal Information Access (Temporalia)](http://ntcirtemporalia.github.io/)
- [NTCIR Interactive Visual Exploration (VisEx)](http://must.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/visex/hiki.cgi?FrontE)
