## About ISR Lab

ISR Lab was launched in April 2017 by merging two labs run by Hideo Joho and Haitao Yu. Hideo Joho joined University of Tsukuba in 2009, while Haitao Yu joined the University in 2014.

Between 2015 and 2016, Haitao visited the IR Group at University of Glasgow, and worked with Prof. Joemon Jose in the School of Computing Science. Meanwhile, Hideo visited the IR Group at RMIT University in 2016, and worked with Prof. Mark Sanderson in the School of Computer Science and Information Technology.

Both Hideo and Haitao thought it was a good moment to launch a new lab with a joint force in April 2017, since both came back to Tsukuba from a long-term visiting in a similar period.

Please see [Research](/en/research.html) for the showcase of research we do in the lab. [Publications](/en/publications.html) have a comprehensive list of our publications. See also [Members](/en/members.html) and [Collaboration](/en/collaboration.html) to find out the members and collaborators of the lab.
